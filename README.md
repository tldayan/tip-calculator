# Tip Calculator App

![Design preview for the Tip calculator app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

This project is my solution for the Tip Calculator App challenge provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). The challenge aimed to create an interactive tip calculator that allows users to calculate the tip amount based on the bill and service quality.

## Overview

The Tip Calculator App challenge focused on building a user-friendly and functional calculator that helps users quickly and accurately calculate the tip amount for a bill. The goal was to create a design that simplifies the process of splitting the bill and determining the appropriate tip percentage.

Throughout the project, I utilized HTML, CSS (with SCSS), and JavaScript to implement the interactive calculator. The objective was to create a visually appealing and responsive interface that allows users to input the bill amount, select the service quality, and calculate the tip amount.

The JavaScript logic handled the calculation of the tip amount based on the selected service quality and the bill amount provided. The SCSS styles were used to enhance the visual presentation and provide a polished look to the calculator.

## Features

- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes
- Input field for entering the bill amount
- Option to select the service quality
- Real-time calculation of the tip amount
- Additional functionality for splitting the bill among multiple people

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- SCSS (CSS preprocessor)
- JavaScript

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/tip-calculator-app.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd tip-calculator-app`

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Enter the bill amount in the input field.
3. Select the desired service quality from the provided options.
4. The tip amount will be calculated and displayed in real-time.
5. Optionally, use the additional functionality to split the bill among multiple people.

## Credits

This project was completed as part of the Tip Calculator App challenge provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).
